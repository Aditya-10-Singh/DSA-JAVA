# 📚 DSA-JAVA

Welcome to **DSA-JAVA** — a personal repository where I’m learning and practicing **Java programming** from the basics to advanced **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## 🚀 About

This repository is structured to help me build a strong foundation in Java and master problem-solving with DSA concepts.  
It includes:

- Core Java syntax and concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections framework
- Basic to advanced Data Structures
- Algorithm implementations
- Practice problems and solutions
